a.) create a temporary value pointing at the value at the first index. Traverse the list, while at each index, comparing 
the temporary value and the value at that index. If the value at the index is less than the temporary value, the temporary 
value becomes the one at that index. An upper bound for this algorithm is O(n) since in the worst case, a comparison and a 
swap are made at each index. This worst case would occur if the list is already sorted in descending order
b.) It would be beneficial to sort the list first using merge sort. Next, find the size of the list and divide it by two. The 
value at this index is the median. Time complexity is O(nlogn) due to the initial presorting. finding the median
itself is only O(1). 
c.) again, presorting the list would be beneficial for this algorithm. using merge sort to sort the list in descending order, 
folowed by simply returning values from indxes 0 through nine, we are given the 10 largets values in the list. Upper bound
for this algorithm is also log linear due to the initial sorting and the return of the 10 values is also constant
